# Capped Collection in MongoDB

A Capped Collection in MongoDB is a fixed-size collection that:

- Stores documents in insertion order (like a circular queue).
- Automatically overwrites the oldest documents when it reaches its size limit.
- Maintains a high-performance insertion order.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it as a ring buffer or FIFO (First-In, First-Out) storage for MongoDB.
